With the "User Access Manager"-plugin you can manage the access to your posts, pages and files.

== Description ==

With the "User Access Manager"-plugin you can manage the access to your posts, pages and files. You only create a user group, put registered users to this and set up the rights for this group. From now the post/page is only accessible for the specified group. This plugin is useful if you need a member area or a private section at your blog.

Feature list

* User groups
* User-defined post/page title (if no access)
* User-defined post/page text (if no access)
* Hide complete post/page
* Hide pages in navigation
* Redirecting users to other pages (if no access)
* Recursive locking of posts/pages
* Limited access to uploaded files
